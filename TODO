Configure:
   - add install target for the python module
   - allways give the correct path in the synaptic.desktop file
     (currently hardcoded)

GUI:
   -  configure whether we want text under icons or not
   - add a button to undo all programmed changes
   - add context-menu on right-click (del/inst/upgr/show descr in own window)

Filter:
   - add missing functionality in rpackagefilter line 183 (Provides filter)
   - add "immutable" filters that can be configured via /etc/synaptic/filters
   - dependencies of selected package
   - dependents of selected package
   - obsolete packages (installed, but no install version available)

General:
   - problem if a pkglist is not available on startup (maybe rpm only?)
   - make log-file
   - current task support is broken, try to fix it
   - implement raptoptions save/restore for getFlags/setFlags 
   - add something that adds cdrom uris to the sources

Done:
   - implement some kind of deborphan functionality (make it a filter)
   - filter for "residual configuration" (removed, but still configuration)
   - make a extra warning if packages are deleted (via Summary Window)
   - label with short description resizes the gui (ugly)
   - add filters to menu (done)
   - make easy way to filter for description 
   - make more than one package selectable and allow "install", "keep" etc
     on this groups (done)
   - remove the update button in rgsrcwindow.cc (done)
   - add more key-shortcuts (done)
   - add repository dialog (done)
   - new packages in repository (done)
   - add cmdline argument for selecting a initial filter (done)
   - test for "swig" in configure.in (done)
   - get rid of all gtk_widget_set_usize() [mostly gone]
   - use colors to show different stuff about the package 
     (e.g. blue if upgradeable, red if broken etc) [done]
   - some online-help/mini-tutorial (partly done)
   - handle "|" case in WDepends (partly)
   - implement "Hold package" (partly)
