Configure:
   - add install target for the python module
   - allways give the correct path in the synaptic.desktop file
     (currently hardcoded)
   - enable different sorting methods for the tree (e.g. size)
   - add easy way to install suggested/recommended

GUI:
   - make a the used font in the treeview configurable 
   - add a button to undo all programmed changes 
	(do we need this now that we have a "real" undo?)
   - add context-menu on right-click (del/inst/upgr/show descr in own window,
     install suggested/recommend)
   - display all files of a installed packages (like dpkg -L or apt-file) 
   - convert all GtkCList to GtkTreeView

Filter:
   - make it possible to filter for maintainer
   - add missing functionality in rpackagefilter line 183 (Provides filter)
   - add "immutable" filters that can be configured via /etc/synaptic/filters
   - dependencies of selected package
   - dependents of selected package
   - obsolete packages (installed, but no install version available)

General:
   - make log-file
   - current task support is broken, try to fix it
   - implement raptoptions save/restore for getFlags/setFlags 
   - make deporhan a native synaptic filter (should be easy)

Done:

   - problem if a pkglist is not available on startup (rpm only)
   - implement some kind of deborphan functionality (make it a filter)
